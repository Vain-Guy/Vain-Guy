# 👋 Hi, I'm Norman (Vain-Guy)

### Data Scientist | AI Prompting Specialist | Machine Learning Explorer 🤖

I’m a data-driven problem solver obsessed with uncovering insights from chaos. I turn raw datasets into stories, predictions, and strategies that make sense—and sometimes, a little mischief.  

## 🔦 About Me
- 🔭 Currently building AI experiments, predictive models, and advanced analytics pipelines  
- 🌱 Continuously leveling up in **Python, Machine Learning, NLP, Feature Engineering, and Deep Learning**  
- 👯 Open to collaborations on **AI, predictive modeling, and data-heavy projects**  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I survive on peanut butter, playlists, and data chaos. If my scatter plots blink at me… I blink back.
