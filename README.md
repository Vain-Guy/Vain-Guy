# 👋 Hey, I’m Norman 
**Data Scientist & Analyst | Machine Learning Engineer | Web Developer**  

I turn messy datasets into sharp, decision-driving insights. My work blends machine learning, data visualization, and storytelling to help people understand **not just the numbers, but the meaning behind them**.  

Whether it’s predicting academic performance from social media habits, mapping complex conflict relationships across Africa, or dissecting the economics of cinema, I aim for impact: solutions that are as practical as they are insightful.  

When I’m not wrangling data, I’m writing about it on [Unsupervised Thoughts (Substack)](https://unsupervisedthoughts1.substack.com); because insights should be shared, not hidden in a spreadsheet.
